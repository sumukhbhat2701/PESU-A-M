pointers:
- pointers and address
  address : low level mechanism
  pointer : high level mechanism - has a type
  
program in a state of execution : process
process : virtual address space
        : different segments
        text segment : machine code equivalent of the program
        Data segment : all global and static variables
        				string literals
        stack segment : local variables in a block (automatic)
        heap segment  : dynamic memory
 
int a;       
&a => virtual address
-------------
pointer:
	1. alias : more than one pointer points to the same location
	changing the referrent thro one will also affect the referrent through the other 
	2. dangling pointer : no loc; access
	3. garbage => memory leak : loc; no access
