Fine Techniques: Day21-22 : 5th April 2021
so far,
discussing the concept of state space search
created :
	state
		set
		display
		compare states
		
	transitions
	
----------
make :
	track dependencies between files
	recreate the target when the dependent files change
-----------
solve:
a) create a graph
   find a path from start state to goal state
b) generate the path from start state to goal state
   use some traversal technique - depth first search
   our soln : list
   start from the start state
   while not reached the goal state
   	make a transition
   	if state is valid and not repeated
   		add to the list
   	else
   		if more transition possible
   			try the next transition from that state
   		else
   			backtrack
 -------------
 
 create a list of states
 - init_list
 - add_list
 - remove_list
 - disp_list
 - is_repeated
