int is_valid(const state_t *ptr_state)
{
	return ptr_state->can <= ptr_state->mis;
}
As per the puzzle, the # of cannibals should not exceed # of missionaries.
The above function

is correct
is incorrect as the state will be reversed on the other bank
is incorrect as boatpos is not checked
is incorrect as fnindex is not checked

---------

to check whether the two states are same, 
we should compare

# of can and # of mis
# of can and # of mis and boatpos
# of can and # of mis and boatpos and fn_index
none of these
