How to add a node in a list on hard disk when there are no free nodes in the middle?

fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END); then write
find the size of file in # of nodes- say size- then fseek(fp, size, SEEK_SET);
    then write
find the size of file in # of bytes- say size- then fseek(fp, size + 1, SEEK_SET);
    then write
find the size of file in # of bytes- say size- then fseek(fp, size, SEEK_END);
    then write
 
State which of the following is true

fseek is efficient as it has no disk access
fseek and read are equally efficient
fseek is efficient as it has no system call
fseek modifies the size of file on the hard disk
