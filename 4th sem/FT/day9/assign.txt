1. Implement the solution to the prison problem.
A prison has cells numbered from 1 to n (some input size). All cells are closed.
The warden walks along the cells - opens it if closed, closes it if open.
He repeats for multiples of 1, 2, ..., until n.
Prisoners in the cells which are open are free to go. Which cells are open at the end?
Write a program to do it.
a) represent each cell by an int
b) represent each cell by a bit
c) Do you find a pattern ? Give reasons.

2. Given an unordered sequence of (n - 1) unique numbers in the range 1 to n, find the
missing number. Solve it programmatically.

3. Given 12 marbles out of which one is odd - may be heavier or lighter compared to others,
find the odd one.
