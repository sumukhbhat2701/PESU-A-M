n & (n - 1) is not zero

if the number is even
if the number is an exact power of 2
if the number is not an exact power of 2
if the number is an exact power of 10

a = ...; // some unsigned int value
b = ...; // some unsigned int value
a = a ^ b;
b = a ^ b;
a = a ^ b;

both a and b become 0
a and b get swapped
both a and b have the old value of a
both a and b have the old value of b
