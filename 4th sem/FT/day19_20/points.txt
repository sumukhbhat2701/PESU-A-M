puzzle :
There is a river. On its left bank, there are 3 cannibals, 3 missioneries.
There is a boat which can carry two people. they have to row the boat.
Cannibals and missioneries have to cross the river.
Cannibals are not yet tamed. If the # of cannibals exceeds the number of missioneries,
the cannibals will eat the missioneries.
How do we take all of them to the right bank?
------------
state space search:
a graph of states
a start state
a goal state
apply transitions
check for safe states
check repeated states
move from start state to goal state :
	path in a graph
	(is a list)
---------
do not make the graph
depth first search : generate the nodes as and when required
apply the transitions from the current state in some order
if  the transition results in a safe and not repeated state,
	add that to a solution list
if no more transitions, we backtrack
