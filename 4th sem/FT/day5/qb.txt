Hook an example to show that
	a = a + b
	a += b
	are not same in Python.

on fork, 
	what happens to virtual address of
		local varibles
		global variables
		static variables
		dynamic variables
	in parent and child?
	Do any of these share the location?
	
int a = 10;
int *foo()
{
	int b = 20;
	static int c = 30;
	return ___;
}

which of the following is logically correct?
	return &a;
	return &b;
	return &c;
Why?
