int *p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
// ...
free(p);

p is NULL after p
p is a dangling pointer
*p is a dangling pointer
free should be called as free(&p)

void what(int *x, int *y)
{
	int temp = *x; *x = *y; *y = temp;
}

int a[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int b[5] = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
swap(a, b);

swaps two arrays
swaps a[0] and b[0]
gives compile time error
gives runtime error
