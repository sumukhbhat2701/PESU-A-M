Assignment 1 : shared this evening

Lecture 7_8:
Fine Techniques : 2nd Feb 2021

so far,
build cycle:
	pre-processing, compiling, linking, loading, running
pointers:
	virtual address
	functions with pointers as parameters
	dynamic memory management
		book keeping or house keeping
		
hijacking function:
- profiling
- safety:
	malloc
	free
------------------------------
why not global variables?
- not that the variable could be changed

- clash of global names (not only for variables)
	could have hole-in-scope
- function written for a global variable is not very useful
- variable standing for a data structure is not very useful
-------------------------------

memory manager:
- block of bytes
- request for a block :
	allocate a block
	also store book keeping
	return a pointer
- release of a block
	deallocate - mark that block as free
