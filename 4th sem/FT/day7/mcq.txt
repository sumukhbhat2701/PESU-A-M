On allocation, the memory block contains an int sized book keeping and the a block
of requested size. This function should return

a pointer to the whole block starting from book keeping
a pointer to the requested block after book keeping
two pointers one points the beginning of the requested block and one points to the
	end of the block
none of these

to collapse blocks on free, the memory manager 

should follow the blocks in the order in which the nodes are created
should follow the free blocks contiguously
shoild follow the filled blocks contiguously
none of these
