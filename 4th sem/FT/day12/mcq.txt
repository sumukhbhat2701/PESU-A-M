In the array implementation of list we discussed,
the initial value of head is 

-1
0
NULL
1

We want to delete a node indexed by pres. prev is an index to the node before
present in the order of traversal. The list is not empty. pres is not same as head.
The correct code is 

link[prev] = link[pres];
link[pres] = link[prev];
link[pres] = link[pres - 1];
link[prev + 1] = link[pres];
