sorting a big file on a harddisk:
- external sorting:
	- break the file into small parts; do internal sorting
	  write back these files into harddisk
	  best possible worst case for comparison based sorting: O(n logn)
	- combine these files by merging - k way merge

	what if we arrange the smallest in each stream in the form of a minheap?
		removal : log k
		insert : log k
	to find the smallest repeatedly : use heap
	heap sort in not recommended

	why we should not use linked list - Stroustrup

 - Jon Bentley : confession of the coder
   	requirement : sort one million 7 digit integers - all unique
   	can we represent each # as a bit?
   	
	
	put the numbers into an array - where posn of each bit indicates a number
	traverse from the beginning till end - the numbers will be in order
	- bucketsort : linear
