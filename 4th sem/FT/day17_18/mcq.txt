int what(int a, int (*op)(int))
{
	return op(a);
}
int foo(int x) { return x % 2; }
int main()
{
	int res =  what(25, foo);
}

syntax error
res becomes 25
res become 0
res becomes 1

int (*foo[4])(int, int);
Which of the following is syntactically correct?

foo[1](2, 3)
foo(2, 3)[1]
foo(1)[2, 3]
foo(2, 3)
