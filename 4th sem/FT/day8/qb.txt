What is the best possible worst case for sorting based on worstcase?
Why is heapsort not preferred?
In bubblesort, you may compare a[j] with  a[j + 1] using < or <=. What difference would 
	that make?
Is insertionsort stable? inplace?

In modified insertsort, I will find the smallest element and bring it to the leftmost
position - then insert the remaining n-1 elements. Would this make any difference
in the insert algorithm?
